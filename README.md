# Anomaly-Detection-in-Equity-Markets
I conduct anomaly detection in the US equity market using deep learning and the price and volume of three major index etfs: SPY (S&amp;P 500 etf), QQQ (NASDAQ etf), and DIA (Dow etf). I first prepare the price and volume data by creating logarithmic return and volume columns. I then train an auto-encoder model in TensorFlow in order to detect patterns using the model's reconstruction error.
